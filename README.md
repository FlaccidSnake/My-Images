**My Images** is a searchable media browser and image management tool for Anki. It allows you to quickly find, preview, and insert images from your existing media collection directly into the card editor.

**Use Case**
I often reuse good images I already have in the media folder. They're only searchable if I rename them, so best practices is to rename your screenshots to something other than the default. I use this excellent addon all the time: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1560623518. If you don't want to use this, I yoinked the rename code and included it in this addon, because it's useless without images with useful names. 

I treat image names in anki like tags, I add every key word I can think of to the filename.

## Features
* **Searchable Media Browser:** Search your entire Anki media library by filename while editing a card.
* **Visual Previews:** Hover over any search result to see a large preview of the image.
* **One-Click Insertion:** Click a thumbnail to instantly insert that image into your current field.
* **Smart Renaming:** Right-click any image in the editor (or the browser) to rename it. The add-on automatically updates every single note in your collection that uses that image so your links never break.
